# Laravel API Resources (Transformers)
Laravel API Resources provide a clean way to transform your models and collections into JSON responses for APIs. They act as transformers to format data before sending it to clients.

### Why Use API Resources?

* Consistent, customizable JSON structure.
* Hide sensitive or unnecessary data.
* Add extra fields or relationships easily.
* Support for single models and collections.
