# What are Service Providers in Laravel?
In Laravel, Service Providers are the central place to configure, bind, and register everything your application needs â€” services, classes, events, routes, views, etc.
Think of them as bootstrappers for different parts of your Laravel app.


### Why Are Service Providers Important?

**They tell Laravel:**
* What code to load
* How to bind interfaces to classes
* What routes, views, or observers to register
* How to configure third-party or custom packages


### Common Examples
| Service Provider           | Purpose                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `AppServiceProvider`       | General app bindings/configs  |
| `AuthServiceProvider`      | Authorization policies setup  |
| `RouteServiceProvider`     | Load web/api routes           |
| `EventServiceProvider`     | Register events and listeners |
| `BroadcastServiceProvider` | For broadcasting channels     |
